## Assignment of DOIs

### Overview

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) will be assigned to eligible research outputs deposited into our institutional repository. This process ensures that each output is uniquely identified and can be reliably cited and accessed.

### Key Principles

1. **Uniqueness**: Each DOI assigned will be unique to the specific research output, ensuring that it can be distinguished from other works.
2. **Persistence**: DOIs are designed to be persistent, meaning they will remain valid even if the location of the output changes over time.
3. **Compliance with DataCite**: All DOIs assigned must comply with DataCite's guidelines and standards, ensuring interoperability and consistency across different repositories and systems.
4. **No Duplicate DOIs**: Researchers are discouraged from registering duplicate DOIs for the same content from different providers, as this can lead to citation and versioning issues.

### Process for DOI Assignment

1. **Submission**: Researchers submit their research outputs to the institutional repository, ensuring they meet the eligibility criteria.
2. **Review**: Repository administrators review the submissions to confirm they meet the eligibility criteria and are properly formatted.
3. **DOI Registration**: Once approved, a DOI is generated and registered with DataCite or another approved DOI registration agency.
4. **Metadata Creation**: Comprehensive metadata is created and linked to the DOI, facilitating discovery and access to the output.

### Versioning

- **New Versions**: If significant changes are made to a research output, a new version will be created and assigned a new DOI. The new DOI will be linked to the previous version to maintain a version history.
- **Metadata Updates**: Minor updates to metadata can be made without creating a new version, following DataCite best practices for metadata management.


### Responsibilities

- **Researchers**: Ensure that their submissions meet the eligibility criteria and provide accurate metadata.
- **Repository Administrators**: Manage the DOI assignment process, ensure compliance with DataCite standards, and maintain accurate records of DOIs and associated metadata.

By following these guidelines, our institution ensures that DOIs are consistently and effectively used to enhance the visibility and impact of our research outputs.

## Modifications to Research Outputs

### Overview

Modifications to research outputs can occur for various reasons, such as updates, corrections, or new versions. This section outlines how these changes are managed in relation to DOIs.

### Types of Modifications

1. **Minor Updates**: These include corrections to metadata, minor textual changes, or updates to supplementary materials. Minor updates do not require a new DOI.
2. **Major Updates**: These involve significant changes to the content, such as new data, revised conclusions, or substantial rewrites. Major updates typically require a new version of the output and a new DOI.
3. **Versioning**: When a new version of a research output is created due to major updates, it will be assigned a new DOI. The new DOI will be linked to the previous version to maintain a version history.

### Managing Modifications

- **Metadata Updates**: Minor updates to metadata can be made without creating a new version. These changes should follow DataCite best practices for metadata management.
- **New Versions**: When creating a new version, researchers must ensure that the updated output meets the eligibility criteria for DOI assignment.
- **Version Control**: The institutional repository will maintain a record of all versions of a research output, including their respective DOIs, to ensure transparency and traceability.


### Best Practices

- **Documentation**: All modifications should be documented, including the nature of the changes and the date they were made.
- **Transparency**: Researchers should clearly indicate in the output itself if it is a revised version, including any changes made.
- **Citation**: When citing previous versions, researchers should use the DOI of the specific version being referenced.

By managing modifications effectively, our institution ensures that research outputs remain accurate, reliable, and easily accessible over time.


## Exceptions

While this policy aims to provide a comprehensive framework for assigning DOIs to research outputs, there are certain exceptions and considerations that must be addressed.

### Types of Exceptions

1. **Restricted Data**: DOIs will not be assigned to data intended for restricted access or with unresolved legal, ethical, or contractual issues. This includes sensitive information, confidential data, or outputs subject to embargo.
2. **Research Theses**: Modifications to thesis records are only accepted until the final version is deposited. Once a thesis is finalized and assigned a DOI, no further changes will be permitted.
3. **Copyright and Licensing Issues**: Outputs that infringe on copyright or violate licensing agreements will not be assigned DOIs until these issues are resolved.
4. **Ethical or Legal Concerns**: Outputs that raise ethical or legal concerns, such as those involving human subjects without proper consent, will not be assigned DOIs until these concerns are addressed.

### Handling Exceptions

- **Review Process**: All exceptions will undergo a thorough review by the repository administrators and relevant stakeholders to ensure compliance with institutional policies and legal requirements.
- **Documentation**: Decisions regarding exceptions will be documented, including the reasons for the exception and any conditions that must be met before a DOI can be assigned.
- **Alternative Solutions**: In cases where a DOI cannot be assigned, alternative identifiers or solutions may be explored to ensure that the output remains accessible and citable.


### Appeals Process

Researchers who disagree with a decision regarding an exception can appeal through the institutional repository's formal appeals process. This process will involve a review by a designated committee to ensure fairness and consistency in applying the policy.

By addressing these exceptions, our institution ensures that DOIs are used responsibly and in compliance with legal, ethical, and institutional standards.
