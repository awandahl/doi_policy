# doi_policy



## Introduction

In line with KTH Royal Institute of Technology's commitment to enhancing the visibility, accessibility, and impact of research outputs, KTH is implementing a comprehensive Digital Object Identifier (DOI) policy. This policy is designed to ensure that our scholarly works, including datasets, theses, and reports and other research outputs in the TRITA series, are assigned unique and persistent identifiers that facilitate their discovery, citation, and reuse. By adopting DOIs, we aim to promote transparency, accountability, and collaboration within the academic community, while aligning with international standards for data sharing and management. This policy outlines the guidelines and best practices for DOI registration, ensuring compliance with DataCite and Crossref requirements and supporting our institution's mission to advance knowledge and innovation.

## Scope

This Digital Object Identifier (DOI) policy applies to the following research outputs:

- **Datasets**: Raw data, processed data, and metadata associated with research projects.
- **Theses and Dissertations**: Final versions of graduate theses.
- **Outputs in the TRITA series**: Reports and other research outputs belonging to the TRITA series.

This policy is applicable to all researchers, faculty members, and staff involved in creating and managing these research outputs.

## Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), research outputs must meet the following criteria:

1. **Embrace FAIR Principles**: The output must adhere to the FAIR principles, ensuring that it is **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable**, and **Reusable**.
2. **High-Quality Metadata**: The output must be accompanied by comprehensive metadata that conforms to Dublin Core standards or other accepted metadata formats. This includes, but is not limited to, title, author(s), abstract, keywords, and relevant identifiers such as ORCiD iDs.
3. **Open File Formats**: The output should be in open file formats to facilitate accessibility and reusability. Exceptions may be made for proprietary formats if they are widely used in the field and no suitable open alternative exists.
4. **Sufficient Documentation**: The output must include a minimum of a README file or equivalent documentation that provides detailed information about the content, usage rights, and any specific requirements for access or reuse.
5. **Original Content**: The output must be original work created by the authors or contributors. If the output includes third-party materials, appropriate permissions or licenses must be obtained and documented.
6. **Compliance with Legal and Ethical Standards**: The output must comply with all relevant legal and ethical standards, including copyright laws, data protection regulations, and institutional policies on research integrity.

### Situations Where a DOI May Not Be Issued

- **Conflict with Existing DOIs**: If a DOI already exists for the same data, such as one created by another institution, repository, publisher, or data center, a new DOI will not be issued. Researchers will be notified, and alternative solutions will be explored.
- **Eligibility Criteria Not Met**: Research outputs lacking high-quality metadata, failing to adhere to FAIR principles, or not meeting other eligibility criteria will not be assigned a DOI until these issues are resolved.
- **Restricted Data**: DOIs will not be assigned to data intended for highly restricted access, as this contradicts the purpose of DOIs in facilitating open access and discoverability.
- **Significant Changes**: If the data linked to a DOI will undergo significant changes, a new DOI should be created for each major version or update to maintain version control and clarity.
- **Legal, Ethical, or Contractual Issues**: Outputs with unresolved legal, ethical, or contractual issues at the time of registration will not be assigned a DOI until these concerns are addressed.
- **Technical Issues**: In rare cases, technical issues may temporarily prevent DOI assignment. Repository administrators will work with researchers to resolve these issues and facilitate DOI registration as soon as possible.

## Assignment of DOIs

### Overview

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) will be assigned to eligible research outputs deposited into our institutional repository DiVA or KTH Data Repository. This process ensures that each output is uniquely identified and can be reliably cited and accessed.

### Key Principles

1. **Uniqueness**: Each DOI assigned will be unique to the specific research output, ensuring that it can be distinguished from other works.
2. **Persistence**: DOIs are designed to be persistent, meaning they will remain valid even if the location of the output changes over time.
3. **Compliance with DataCite or Crossref**: All DOIs assigned must comply with DataCite's or Crossref's guidelines and standards, ensuring interoperability and consistency across different repositories and systems.
4. **No Duplicate DOIs**: Researchers are discouraged from registering duplicate DOIs for the same content from different providers, as this can lead to citation and versioning issues.

### Process for DOI Assignment

1. **Submission**: Researchers submit their research outputs to the institutional repository DiVA or KTH Data Repository, ensuring they meet the eligibility criteria.
2. **Review**: Repository administrators review the submissions to confirm they meet the eligibility criteria and are properly formatted.
3. **DOI Registration**: Once approved, a DOI is generated and registered with DataCite or Crossref.
4. **Metadata Creation**: Comprehensive metadata is created and linked to the DOI, facilitating discovery and access to the output.

### Versioning

- **New Versions**: If significant changes are made to a research output, a new version will be created and assigned a new DOI. The new DOI will be linked to the previous version to maintain a version history.
- **Metadata Updates**: Minor updates to metadata can be made without creating a new version, following DataCite or Crossref best practices for metadata management.

### Responsibilities

- **Researchers**: Ensure that their submissions meet the eligibility criteria and provide accurate metadata.
- **Repository Administrators**: Manage the DOI assignment process, ensure compliance with DataCite or Crossref standards, and maintain accurate records of DOIs and associated metadata.

## Modifications to Research Outputs

### Overview

Modifications to research outputs can occur for various reasons, such as updates, corrections, or new versions. This section outlines how these changes are managed in relation to DOIs.

### Types of Modifications

1. **Minor Updates**: These include corrections to metadata, minor textual changes, or updates to supplementary materials. Minor updates do not require a new DOI.
2. **Major Updates**: These involve significant changes to the content, such as new data, revised conclusions, or substantial rewrites. Major updates typically require a new version of the output and a new DOI.
3. **Versioning**: When a new version of a research output is created due to major updates, it will be assigned a new DOI. The new DOI will be linked to the previous version to maintain a version history.

### Managing Modifications

- **Metadata Updates**: Minor updates to metadata can be made without creating a new version. These changes should follow DataCite best practices for metadata management.
- **New Versions**: When creating a new version, researchers must ensure that the updated output meets the eligibility criteria for DOI assignment.
- **Version Control**: The institutional repository will maintain a record of all versions of a research output, including their respective DOIs, to ensure transparency and traceability.

### Best Practices

- **Documentation**: All modifications should be documented, including the nature of the changes and the date they were made.
- **Transparency**: Researchers should clearly indicate in the output itself if it is a revised version, including any changes made.
- **Citation**: When citing previous versions, researchers should use the DOI of the specific version being referenced.

## Exceptions

While this policy aims to provide a comprehensive framework for assigning DOIs to research outputs, there are certain exceptions and considerations that must be addressed.

### Types of Exceptions

1. **Restricted Data**: DOIs will not be assigned to data intended for restricted access or with unresolved legal, ethical, or contractual issues. This includes sensitive information, confidential data, or outputs subject to embargo.
2. **Research Theses**: Modifications to thesis records are only accepted until the final version is deposited. Once a thesis is finalized and assigned a DOI, no further changes will be permitted.
3. **Copyright and Licensing Issues**: Outputs that infringe on copyright or violate licensing agreements will not be assigned DOIs until these issues are resolved.
4. **Ethical or Legal Concerns**: Outputs that raise ethical or legal concerns, such as those involving human subjects without proper consent, will not be assigned DOIs until these concerns are addressed.

### Handling Exceptions

- **Review Process**: All exceptions will undergo a thorough review by the repository administrators and relevant stakeholders to ensure compliance with institutional policies and legal requirements.
- **Documentation**: Decisions regarding exceptions will be documented, including the reasons for the exception and any conditions that must be met before a DOI can be assigned.
- **Alternative Solutions**: In cases where a DOI cannot be assigned, alternative identifiers or solutions may be explored to ensure that the output remains accessible and citable.


### Appeals Process

Researchers who disagree with a decision regarding an exception can appeal through the institutional repository's formal appeals process. This process will involve a review by a designated committee to ensure fairness and consistency in applying the policy.

By addressing these exceptions, our institution ensures that DOIs are used responsibly and in compliance with legal, ethical, and institutional standards.
